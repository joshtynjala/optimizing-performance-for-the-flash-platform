# Deploying

When exporting the final version of your application in Flash Builder, it is
important to make sure that you export the release version of it. Exporting a
release version removes the debugging information contained in the SWF file.
Removing the debugging information makes the SWF file size smaller and helps the
application to run faster.

To export the release version of your project, use the Project panel in Flash
Builder and the Export Release Build option.

> **Note:** When compiling your project in Flash Professional, you do not have
> the option of choosing between release and debugging version. The compiled SWF
> file is a release version by default.
